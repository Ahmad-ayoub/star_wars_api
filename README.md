Fetching SWAPI Data
* The app fetches data from the SWAPI endpoints using the fetch API or a library like Axios.
* Fetched data includes details about movies, characters, planets, starships, and other relevant entities.

Storing Data with useState
* The useState hook is used to store and manage the fetched data within the app's state.
* This allows the app to update the UI dynamically based on the current data.

As seen here you can type in any name you want and it will only show said character with their respective details:

Displaying Data with Components
* React components are used to present the fetched data in an organized and structured manner.
* Components can be created for movies, characters, planets, starships, and other relevant entities.

You can also toggle back and forth between the whole SWAPI data base through the 'previous' and 'next' buttons:

Bootstrap Styling
* Leveraged Bootstrap's CSS classes and components for styling the app's UI.
* Applied responsive design, grid system, and customizable components for an aesthetically pleasing user interface.

Handling Side Effects with useEffect
* The useEffect hook is employed to handle side effects, such as fetching data from the SWAPI when the app loads.
* Controlled when and how the side effects occur by specifying dependencies.
