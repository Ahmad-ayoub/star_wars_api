# React API App
Introducing a user-friendly Star Wars API (SWAPI) app built with React, useState, useEffect hooks, and Bootstrap for an immersive exploration of the Star Wars universe.

## Built with the React framework
* Developed using the React library for building efficient and interactive user interfaces.
* Leveraged the power of React components and hooks for modular code and efficient state management.

## Intuitive interface
* Users can easily navigate through the app to access information about Star Wars movies, characters, planets, starships, and more.
* Utilized Bootstrap's responsive design and pre-built components for a visually appealing and user-friendly layout.

Fetching SWAPI Data
* The app fetches data from the SWAPI endpoints using the fetch API or a library like Axios.
* Fetched data includes details about movies, characters, planets, starships, and other relevant entities.

Storing Data with useState
* The useState hook is used to store and manage the fetched data within the app's state.
* This allows the app to update the UI dynamically based on the current data.

Displaying Data with Components
* React components are used to present the fetched data in an organized and structured manner.
* Components can be created for movies, characters, planets, starships, and other relevant entities.

Bootstrap Styling
* Leveraged Bootstrap's CSS classes and components for styling the app's UI.
* Applied responsive design, grid system, and customizable components for an aesthetically pleasing user interface.

Handling Side Effects with useEffect
* The useEffect hook is employed to handle side effects, such as fetching data from the SWAPI when the app loads.
* Controlled when and how the side effects occur by specifying dependencies.

Deployment with Heroku
* The app is deployed using Heroku, a cloud platform for hosting web applications.
* Heroku simplifies the deployment process, ensuring the app is accessible online.
